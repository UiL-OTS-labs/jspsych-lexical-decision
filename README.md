# jspsych-lexical-decision
[Lexical Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task)
This boilerplate experiment is designed to run multiple kinds of lexical
decision. The lexical descision may be based on an auditory or visual
stimulus. The target word may be preceded by an optionally masked prime.
This experiment is based on the previous experiments of the Uil-OTS labs:

- **jspsych-vislexdec**       lexical decision (visual target stimulus)
- **jspsych-vislexdec-vp**    lexical decision (visual target stimulus) + visual prime
- **jspsych-vislexdec-vp-vm** lexcial decision (visual target stimulus) + visual masked prime
- **jspsych-audlexdec**       lexical decision (auditory target stimulus)
- **jspsych-audlexdec-ap**    lexical decision (auditory target stimulus) + auditory prime
- **jspsych-audlexdec-vp**    lexical decision (auditory target stimulus) + visual prime
- **jspsych-audlexdec-vp-vm** lexical decision (auditory target stimulus) + visual masked prime

however, it is one experient capable of running all subflavors above. The list
of stimuli will determine what subflavor will presentented to the subjects of this
experiment.

# Generic documentation
Please read the [generic documentation](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-uil-template-docs)
for some context and scope.

# Task Description
Auditory or visual lexcial decision task: the participant first sees a fixation
cross, this marks the onset of an trial. Then optionally an auditory or visual
prime is presented. The visual prime may be subsequently masked. Finally the
participants hear or see a real or non existing word (non-word). The task is
to respond as quickly as possible and indicate wether the heard word is a real
word or not.

Crucial trial phases (sub trial phases):
- Fixation cross
- Visual/auditory Prime
- Visual Mask ('#####')
- Target visual or auditory stimulus (Decision phase)

# Output

The data of _all_ (sub) _trial phases_ are logged in the data, but the output
 data can be filtered after data collection in many ways.
Please read the
[general primer on jsPsych's data](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-output)
if you are new to jsPsych data output.

Essential output for the _'true experimental'_ purpose in this template are:

- Reaction Time (RT) of the keyboard response in the decision phase
- Correctness of the keyboard response in the decision phase

The crucial trial/sub-trial phase (decision phase) output may look similar to this:

# Getting started 
People _affiliated with our lab_ can use the information
[from our lab webiste](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/experiments/overview/)
and expand the "Online experiments using jsPsych" section for details. Please
follow [this how-to](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/how-to/online-experimenting/).

## Make your experiment ready for use with the data server

### Update access key
In the file `globals.js` is a variable:
```javascript
const ACCESS_KEY = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
```
Before uploading your experimentto the UiL-OTS data server, you will need to
change this to the access_key that you obtained when your experiment was
approved. For elaborate info see `globals.js`.

### Adapting stimuli
- Open the file `stimuli.js` in your plain text editor.
- There is a list, called LIST_1:

```javacript
  const LIST_1 = [ // stimuli and timeline variables
```
- This list can be adapted to your own needs, i.e, you can replace values,
  make the list longer (don't forget to increment the 'id' values for new items!).
- If you need to implement a more complex design, you should read the
  `stimuli.js` file (and its comment sections) a little better.
- For an example of a Latin square design, please have a look
  [here](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-spr-mw).
